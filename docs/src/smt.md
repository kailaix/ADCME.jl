# Managing Numerical Experiments with SMT

Suppose we want to run many numerical , how do we manage our experiment and analysis?
ADCMEKit.jl provides a solution based on [Sumatra](https://github.com/open-research/sumatra).

When you install ADCMEKit.jl, a custom version of Sumatra is also installed on your system. Therefore,
you do not need to install anything manually.

Assume that we start a new project `MyProject` (folder name). We use Git for version control. To start a SMT server,
in the `MyProject` directory, do

```@example smt
using ADCMEKit
init_smt()
```

Now you can see a `.smt` directory in your folder.

Lets create some files. The first file is `test.jl`:

```@example smt
using DelimitedFiles
include("dep.jl")
writedlm("Data/data.txt", ones(10,10)*a)
```

The second file is `dep.jl`:

```@example smt
a = 10
```

One crucial step is to **commit** your files in the version control system because SMT manages files according to their git version.
After that, you can run

```bash
$ smt run -m test.jl
```

Here `-m` marks `test.jl` as the main file. We can also do a global configuration

```bash
$ smt configure -m test.jl
```

So next time we only need to call `smt run` to run the file.

SMT provides a web-based visualization tool to visualize your tasks. To start the web server, do

```bash
$ smtweb
```

Here are some snapshots for the web-based visualization tool.

**Configurations**

There are several useful configurations for `smt configure`.

```
optional arguments:
  -d PATH, --datapath PATH
                        set the path to the directory in which smt will search
                        for datafiles generated by the simulation or analysis.
  -l OPTION, --addlabel OPTION
                        If this option is set, smt will append the record
                        label either to the command line (option 'cmdline') or
                        to the parameter file (option 'parameters'), and will
                        add the label to the datapath when searching for
                        datafiles. It is up to the user to make use of this
                        label inside their program to ensure files are created
                        in the appropriate location.
  -e PATH, --executable PATH
                        set the path to the executable.
  -m MAIN, --main MAIN  the name of the script that would be supplied on the
                        command line if running the simulator normally, e.g.
                        init.hoc.
```

**Example: Submit a Batch Job**

```bash
set +x
smt configure -l cmdline # 1
for o in 1 2 3 4 5 
do 
smt run --label $o -e 'srun julia' $o & # 2
sleep 1  # 3
done 
wait 
```

`#1` will ensure that each job will look for output files in `Data/$o`.
