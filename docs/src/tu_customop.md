# Advanced: Custom Operators

!!! note
    As a reminder, there are many built-in custom operators in `deps/CustomOps` and they are good resources for understanding custom operators. The following is a step-by-step instruction on how custom operators are implemented. 

## The Need for Custom Operators 
Custom operators are ways to add missing features or improve performance critical components in ADCME. Typically users do not have to worry about custom operators and performance of prototypes is in general pretty good. However, in the following situation custom opreators might be very useful

- Direct implementation in ADCME is inefficient, e.g., vectorizing some codes is difficult. 
- There are legacy codes users want to reuse, such as Fortran libraries.  
- Special acceleration techniques, such as checkpointing scheme, MPI-enabled linear solvers, and FPGA/GPU-accelerated codes.

## The Philosophy of Implementing Custom Operators

Usually the motivation for implementing custom operators is to enable gradient backpropagation for some performance critical operators. However, not all performance critical operators participate the automatic differentiation. Therefore, before we devote ourselves to implementating custom operators, we need to identify which operators need to be implemented as custom operators. 

![forwardbackward](https://github.com/ADCMEMarket/ADCMEImages/blob/master/ADCME/forwardbackward.png?raw=true)

This identification task can be done by sketching out the computational graph of your program. Assume your optimization outer loops update $x$ repeatly, then we can trace all downstream the operators that depend on this parameter $x$. We call the dependent operators "tensor operations", because they are essentially TensorFlow operators that consume and output tensors. The dependent variables are called "tensors". The other side of tensors or tensor operations is "numerical arrays" and "numerical operations". The names seem a bit vague here but the essence is that numerical operations/arrays do no participate automatic differentiation during the optimization. They are essentially computed once. 

In ADCME, we can precompute all numerical quantities of numerical arrays using Julia. No TensorFlow operators or custom operators are needed. This procedure combines the best of the two worlds: the simple syntax and high performance computing environment provided by Julia, and the efficient AD capability provided by TensorFlow. The high performance computing for precomputing cannot be provided by Python, the official language that TensorFlow or PyTorch supports. Readers migh suspect that such precomputing may not be significant in many tasks. Actually, the precomputing constitutes a large portion in scientific computing. For example, researchers assemble matrices, prepare geometries and construct preconditioners in a finite element program. These tasks are by no means trivial and cheap. The consideration for  performance in scientific computing actually forms the major motivation behind adopting Julia for the major language for ADCME. 



## Build Custom Operators 

In the following, we present an example of implementing a sparse solver for $Au=b$ as a custom operator.

**Input**: row vector `ii`, column vector`jj` and value vector `vv` for the sparse coefficient matrix $A$; row vector `kk` and value vector `ff` for the right hand side $b$; the coefficient matrix dimension is $d\times d$

**Output**: solution vector $u\in \mathbb{R}^d$


**Step 1: Create and modify the template file**

The following command helps create the wrapper

```julia
customop()
```

There will be a `custom_op.txt` in the current directory. Modify the template file 

```txt
MySparseSolver
int32 ii(?)
int32 jj(?)
double vv(?)
int32 kk(?)
double ff(?)
int32 d()
double u(?) -> output
```

The first line is the name of the operator. It should always be in the camel case. 

The 2nd to the 7th lines specify the input arguments, the signature is `type`+`variable name`+`shape`. For the shape, `()` corresponds to a scalar, `(?)` to a vector and `(?,?)` to a matrix. The variable names must be in *lower cases*. Additionally, the supported types are: `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `double`, `bool` and `string`. 

The last line is the output, denoted by ` -> output` (do not forget the whitespace before and after `->`).  

!!! note
    If there are non-real type outputs, the corresponding top gradients input to the gradient kernel should be removed. 


**Step 2: Implement the kernels**

Run `customop()` again and there will be `CMakeLists.txt`, `gradtest.jl`, `MySparseSolver.cpp` appearing in the current directory. `MySparseSolver.cpp` is the main wrapper for the codes and `gradtest.jl` is used for testing the operator and its gradients. `CMakeLists.txt` is the file for compilation. 

Create a new file `MySparseSolver.h` and implement both the forward simulation and backward simulation (gradients)

```cpp
#include <eigen3/Eigen/Sparse>
#include <eigen3/Eigen/SparseLU>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef Eigen::SparseMatrix<double> SpMat; // declares a column-major sparse matrix type of double
typedef Eigen::Triplet<double> T;

SpMat A;

void forward(double *u, const int *ii, const int *jj, const double *vv, int nv, const int *kk, const double *ff,int nf,  int d){
    vector<T> triplets;
    Eigen::VectorXd rhs(d); rhs.setZero();
    for(int i=0;i<nv;i++){
      triplets.push_back(T(ii[i]-1,jj[i]-1,vv[i]));
    }
    for(int i=0;i<nf;i++){
      rhs[kk[i]-1] += ff[i];
    }
    A.resize(d, d);
    A.setFromTriplets(triplets.begin(), triplets.end());
    auto C = Eigen::MatrixXd(A);
    Eigen::SparseLU<SpMat> solver;
    solver.analyzePattern(A);
    solver.factorize(A);
    auto x = solver.solve(rhs);
    for(int i=0;i<d;i++) u[i] = x[i];
}

void backward(double *grad_vv, const double *grad_u, const int *ii, const int *jj, const double *u, int nv, int d){
    Eigen::VectorXd g(d);
    for(int i=0;i<d;i++) g[i] = grad_u[i];
    auto B = A.transpose();
    Eigen::SparseLU<SpMat> solver;
    solver.analyzePattern(B);
    solver.factorize(B);
    auto x = solver.solve(g);
    // cout << x << endl;
    for(int i=0;i<nv;i++) grad_vv[i] = 0.0;
    for(int i=0;i<nv;i++){
      grad_vv[i] -= x[ii[i]-1]*u[jj[i]-1];
    }
}
```

!!! note
    In this implementation we have used `Eigen` library for solving sparse matrix. Other choices are also possible, such as algebraic multigrid methods. Note here for convenience we have created a global variable `SpMat A;`. This is not recommend if you want to run the code concurrently, since the variable `A` must be overwritten by another concurrent thread. 

**Step 3: Compile**

It is recommended that you use the `cmake`, `make` and `gcc` provided by `ADCME`. The binary locations can be found via

| Variable      | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ADCME.CXX`   | C++ Compiler                          |
| `ADCME.CC`    | C Compiler                            |
| `ADCME.TFLIB` | `libtensorflow_framework.so` location |
| `ADCME.CMAKE` | Cmake binary location                 |
| `ADCME.MAKE`  | Make binary location                  |

ADCME will properly handle the environment variable for you. So we always recommend you to compile custom operators using ADCME functions:

First `cd` into your custom operator director (where `CMakeLists.txt` is located), create a directory `build` if it doesn't exist, `cd` into `build`, and do 

```julia-repl
julia> using ADCME
julia> ADCME.cmake()
julia> ADCME.make()
```
Based on your operation system, you will create `libMySparseSolver.{so,dylib,dll}`. This will be the dynamic library to link in `TensorFlow`. 

**Step 4: Test**

Finally, you could use `gradtest.jl` to test the operator and its gradients (specify appropriate data in `gradtest.jl` first). If you implement the gradients correctly, you will be able to obtain first order convergence for finite difference and second order convergence for automatic differentiation. Note you need to modify this file first, e.g., creating data and modifying the function `scalar_function`. 

![custom_op](https://github.com/ADCMEMarket/ADCMEImages/blob/master/ADCME/custom_op.png?raw=true)

!!! info 
    If the process fails, it is most probable the GCC compiler is not compatible with which was used to compile `libtensorflow_framework.{so,dylib}`. ADCME downloads a  GCC compiler via Conda for you. However, if you follow the above steps but encounter some problems, we are happy to resolve the compatibility issue and improve the robustness of ADCME. Submitting an issue is welcome.


## Build GPU Custom Operators

### Install GPU-enabled TensorFlow (Linux and Windows)

To use  CUDA in ADCME, we need to install a GPU-enabled version of TensorFlow. In ADCME, this is achieved by simply rebuilding ADCME with `GPU` environment variabe. 

```julia
using Pkg
ENV["GPU"] = 1
Pkg.build("ADCME")
```

This will install all GPU dependencies.

### Building a GPU custom operator 

We consider a toy example where the custom operator is a function $f: x\rightarrow 2x$. To begin with, we create a `custom_op.txt` via [`customp`](@ref)

```text
GpuTest
double a(?)
double b(?) -> output
```

Next, by running `customp()` again several template files are generated. We can then do the implementation in those files

**GpuTest.cpp**

```c++
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.h"
#include<cmath>

// Signatures for GPU kernels here 
void return_double(int n, double *b, const double*a);
using namespace tensorflow;


REGISTER_OP("GpuTest")

.Input("a : double")
.Output("b : double")
.SetShapeFn([](::tensorflow::shape_inference::InferenceContext* c) {
    
        shape_inference::ShapeHandle a_shape;
        TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->WithRank(c->input(0), 1, &a_shape));

        c->set_output(0, c->input(0));
    return Status::OK();
  });

REGISTER_OP("GpuTestGrad")

.Input("grad_b : double")
.Input("b : double")
.Input("a : double")
.Output("grad_a : double");


class GpuTestOpGPU : public OpKernel {
private:
  
public:
  explicit GpuTestOpGPU(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {

  }

  void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {    
    DCHECK_EQ(1, context->num_inputs());
    
    
    const Tensor& a = context->input(0);
    
    
    const TensorShape& a_shape = a.shape();
    
    
    DCHECK_EQ(a_shape.dims(), 1);

    // extra check
        
    // create output shape
    int n = a_shape.dim_size(0);
    TensorShape b_shape({n});
            
    // create output tensor
    
    Tensor* b = NULL;
    OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(0, b_shape, &b));
    
    // get the corresponding Eigen tensors for data access
    
    auto a_tensor = a.flat<double>().data();
    auto b_tensor = b->flat<double>().data();   

    // implement your forward function here 

    // TODO:
    return_double(n, b_tensor, a_tensor);

  }
};
REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("GpuTest").Device(DEVICE_GPU), GpuTestOpGPU);

```

**GpuTest.cu**

```c++
#define GOOGLE_CUDA 1
#define EIGEN_USE_GPU

#include "tensorflow/core/framework/register_types.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_types.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/util/gpu_kernel_helper.h"

__global__ void return_double_(int n, double *b, const double*a){
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i<n) b[i] = 2*a[i];
}

void return_double(int n, double *b, const double*a){
    return_double_<<<(n+255)/256, 256>>>(n, b, a);
}
```

set_target_properties(GpuTest PROPERTIES LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/build RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_RELEASE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/build)
```

We can then compile the operator on a system where `nvcc` is available:

```julia
mkdir("build")
cd("build")
ADCME.cmake()
ADCME.make()
```

### Running a GPU custom operator

We can now run a GPU operator by loading the shared library

```julia
using ADCME

function gpu_test(a)
    gpu_test_ = load_op_and_grad("$(@__DIR__)/build/libGpuTest","gpu_test")
    a = convert_to_tensor([a], [Float64]); a = a[1]
    gpu_test_(a)
end

# TODO: specify your input parameters
a = [1.0;3.0;-1.0]
u = gpu_test(a)
sess = Session(); init(sess)
run(sess, u)
```

If we run the file on a system without GPU resources, we will get the following error 

```text
 <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError'>
```

If we have GPU resources, the kernel will run correctly with the output

```julia
2.0
6.0
-2.0
```


## Batch Build

At some point, you might have a lot of custom operators. Building one-by-one will take up too much time. To reduce the building time, you might want to build all the operators all at once concurrently. To this end, you can consider batch build by using a common CMakeLists.txt. The commands in the CMakeLists.txt are the same as a typical custom operator, except that the designated libraries are different

```cmake
# ... The same as a typical CMake script ...

# Specify all the library paths and library names. 
set(LIBDIR_NAME VolumetricStrain ComputeVel DirichletBd
    FemStiffness FemStiffness1 SpatialFemStiffness
    SpatialVaryingTangentElastic Strain Strain1
    StrainEnergy StrainEnergy1)
set(LIB_NAME VolumetricStrain ComputeVel DirichletBd
    FemStiffness UnivariateFemStiffness SpatialFemStiffness
    SpatialVaryingTangentElastic StrainOp StrainOpUnivariate
    StrainEnergy StrainEnergyUnivariate)

# Copy and paste the following lines (no modification is required)
list(LENGTH "LIBDIR_NAME" LIBLENGTH)
message("Total number of libraries to make: ${LIBLENGTH}")
MATH(EXPR LIBLENGTH "${LIBLENGTH}-1")
foreach(IDX RANGE 0 ${LIBLENGTH})
  list(GET LIBDIR_NAME ${IDX} _LIB_DIR)
  list(GET LIB_NAME ${IDX} _LIB_NAME)
  message("Compiling ${IDX}th library: ${_LIB_DIR}==>${_LIB_NAME}")
  file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ${_LIB_DIR}/build)
  add_library(${_LIB_NAME} SHARED ${_LIB_DIR}/${_LIB_NAME}.cpp)
  set_property(TARGET ${_LIB_NAME} PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)
  set_target_properties(${_LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/${_LIB_DIR}/build)
  target_link_libraries(${_LIB_NAME} ${TF_LIB_FILE})
endforeach(IDX)
```


## Error Handling

Sometimes we might encounter error in C++ kernels and we want to propagate the error to the Julia interface. This is done by `OP_REQUIRES_OK`. Its syntax is

```c++
OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, status)
```

where `context` is either a `OpKernelConstruction` or a `OpKernelContext`, and `status` can be created using 

```c++
Status(error::Code::ERROR_CODE, message)
```

Here `ERROR_CODE` is one of the following:

```c++
OK = 0,
CANCELLED = 1,
UNKNOWN = 2,
INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3,
DEADLINE_EXCEEDED = 4,
NOT_FOUND = 5,
ALREADY_EXISTS = 6,
PERMISSION_DENIED = 7,
UNAUTHENTICATED = 16,
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED = 8,
FAILED_PRECONDITION = 9,
ABORTED = 10,
OUT_OF_RANGE = 11,
UNIMPLEMENTED = 12,
INTERNAL = 13,
UNAVAILABLE = 14,
DATA_LOSS = 15,
DO_NOT_USE_RESERVED_FOR_FUTURE_EXPANSION_USE_DEFAULT_IN_SWITCH_INSTEAD_ = 20,
Code_INT_MIN_SENTINEL_DO_NOT_USE_ = std::numeric_limits<::PROTOBUF_NAMESPACE_ID::int32>::min(),
Code_INT_MAX_SENTINEL_DO_NOT_USE_ = std::numeric_limits<::PROTOBUF_NAMESPACE_ID::int32>::max()
```

`message` is a string. 

For example, 

```c++
OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, 
        Status(error::Code::UNAVAILABLE, "Sparse solver type not supported."));
```


## Logging

TensorFlow has a C++ level logging system. We can conveniently log messages to specific streams using the folloing syntax

```c++
VLOG(INFO) << message;
VLOG(WARNING) << message;
VLOG(ERROR) << message;
VLOG(FATAL) << message;
VLOG(NUM_SEVERITIES) << message;
```

## Windows: Load Shared Library

Sometimes you might encounter `NotFoundError()` when using `tf.load_op_library` on Windows system, despite that the library you referred does exist. You can then check using `Libdl`

```julia
using Libdl
dlopen(<MySharedLibrary.dll>)
```

and you still get an error

```
ERROR: could not load library "MySharedLibrary.dll"
The specified module could not be found. 
```

This is annoying. The reason is that when you load this shared library on windows, the system looks for all its dependencies. If at least one of the dependent library is not in the path, then the error occurs. To solve this problem, you need a dependency walker, such as [die.exe](https://gamejolt.com/games/die-exe/36157). 



For example, in the following right panel we see a lot of dynamic libraries. They must be in the system path so that we can load the current dynamic library (`dlopen(...)`). 



|  Main Window    |   Import Window   |
| ---- | ---- |

## Miscellany

### Mutable Inputs
Sometimes we want to modify tensors in place. In this case we can use mutable inputs. Mutable inputs must be [`Variable`](@ref) and it must be forwarded to one of the output. We consider implement a `my_assign` operator, with signature

```
my_assign(u::PyObject, v::PyObject)::PyObject
```

Here `u` is a `Variable` and we copy the data from `v` to `u`. In the `MyAssign.cpp` file, we modify the input and output specifications to 
```c++
.Input("u : Ref(double)")
.Input("v : double")
.Output("w : Ref(double)")
```

In addition, the input tensor is obtained through
```c++
Tensor u = context->mutable_input(0, true);
```
The second argument `lock_held` specifies whether the input mutex is acquired (false) before the operation. Note the output must be a `Tensor` instead of a reference. 

To forward the input, use
```c++
context->forward_ref_input_to_ref_output(0,0);
```

We use the following code snippet to test the program
```julia
my_assign = load_op("./build/libMyAssign","my_assign")
u = Variable([0.1,0.2,0.3])
v = constant(Array{Float64}(1:3))
u2 = u^2
w = my_assign(u,v)
sess = tf.Session()
init(sess)
@show run(sess, u)
@show run(sess, u2)
@show run(sess, w)
@show run(sess, u2)
```

The output is 
```
[0.1,0.2,0.3]
[0.1,0.04,0.09]
[1.0,2.0,3.0]
[1.0,4.0,9.0]
```
We can see that the tensors depending on `u` are also aware of the assign operator. The complete programs can be downloaded here: [CMakeLists.txt](https://kailaix.github.io/ADCME.jl/dev/assets/Codes/mutable/CMakeLists.txt), [MyAssign.cpp](https://kailaix.github.io/ADCME.jl/dev/assets/Codes/mutable/MyAssign.cpp), [gradtest.jl](https://kailaix.github.io/ADCME.jl/dev/assets/Codes/mutable/gradtest.jl).

### Third-party Plugins

ADCME also allows third-party custom operators hosted on Github. To build your own custom operators, implement your own custom operators in a Github repository. 

Users are free to arrange other source files or other third-party libraries. 

Upon using those libraries in ADCME, users first download those libraries to `deps` directory via

```julia
pth = install("OTNetwork")
```

`pth` is the dynamic library product generated with source codes in `OTNetwork`. The official plugins are hosted on `https://github.com/ADCMEMarket`. To get access to the custom operators in ADCME, use

```julia
op = load_op_and_grad(pth, "ot_network"; multiple=true)
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common errors you might encounter during custom operator compilation:

**Q: The cmake output for the Julia path is empty.**

```text
Julia=
```

**A:** Check whether `which julia` outputs the Julia location you are using. 

**Q: The cmake output for Python path, Eigen path, etc., is empty.**

```text
Python path=
EIGEN_INC=
TF_INC=
TF_ABI=
TF_LIB_FILE=
```

**A:** Update ADCME to the latest version and check whether or not the ADCME compiler string is empty

```julia
using ADCME
ADCME.__STR__
```

**Q: Julia package precompilation errors that seem not linked to ADCME.**

**A:** Remove the corresponding packages using `using Pkg; Pkg.rm(XXX)` and reinstall those packages. 

**Q: Precompilation error linked to ADCME**

```text
ERROR: LoadError: ADCME is not properly built; run `Pkg.build("ADCME")` to fix the problem.
```

**A:** Build ADCME using `Pkg.build("ADCME")`. Exit Julia and open Julia again. Check whether `deps.jl` exists in the `deps` directory of your Julia package (optional).


**Q: On Mac, the PyPlot package gives the warning: PyPlot is using tkagg backend, which is known to cause crashes on MacOS (#410); use the MPLBACKEND environment variable to request a different backend.**

**A:** 
```julia
using Conda
Conda.add("pyqt")
using Pkg
Pkg.build("PyPlot")
```
This will install a working backend for PyPlot.
